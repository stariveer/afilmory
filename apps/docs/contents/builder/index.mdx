# Builder

Builder is the unified pipeline (in `packages/builder`) that turns raw assets into the manifest and thumbnails the SPA consumes. It mirrors the “overview → entrypoint → options” cadence used by Vercel’s AI Gateway docs.

## What you get

- 600 px JPEG thumbnail per photo + ThumbHash (`thumbHash`).
- `photos-manifest.json` sorted by capture time, plus `cameras[]`/`lenses[]` dictionaries.
- EXIF (incl. Fujifilm/Sony recipes), GPS, tone analysis, HDR, Motion Photo, and Live Photo markers.
- Optional plugins to sync or rewrite outputs (e.g., upload thumbnails, repo cache).

## How to run it

- **Quick switches:** per-run CLI flags (incremental, force, force-manifest, force-thumbnails, no-ui).
- **Defaults:** `builder.config.ts` for storage, concurrency, logging, plugins.

## Choose your path

- [CLI & run modes](/builder/cli) — flags, concurrency, cluster vs worker.
- [Configuration](/builder/config) — storage providers, system overrides, sample config.
- [Processing flow](/builder/pipeline) — incremental rules, ordering, manifest write-back.
- [Plugins](/builder/plugins) — lifecycle hooks, authoring your own plugin, examples.
- [Built-in plugins](/builder/built-ins) — shipped plugins ready to use.
- [SaaS Mode](/saas) — running Afilmory as a multi-tenant service.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (workspace default) and **Perl** (required by `exiftool-vendored`).
- A valid `builder.config.ts` with at least one storage provider.
